# Justification Diagram Generator

This prototype takes a text file describing a justification diagram inspired by PlantUML syntaxe, in this case *justificationDiagram.JustificationDiagram.txt* and then generates a graph : *graph.png*.

To install, compile and execute, simply input ```make run``` at the root of the project.
